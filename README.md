## Note: ##
This project is in development. It can't be used as of now!
But feel free to contribute!

## What is it?
AGLight is a intiutive software for controlling DMX lights. You can build the userinterface yourself by adding different widgets via Drag and Drop. Building instructions for a console with physical faders and displays will be avalible soon.

The Electron Angular App will send over the dmx universe over to different devices. This is done using the excellent [node-dmx](https://github.com/node-dmx/dmx) library. You can see all supported devices [here](https://github.com/node-dmx/dmx/tree/master/drivers).
